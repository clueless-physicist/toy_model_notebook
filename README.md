# Scripts

Thusfar have a quick script where you can edit:

 - the number of parameters your fitting model uses, N_model
 - the size of eta (point by point fluctuation)
 - the number of data points you fit

then a plot is made which summarises how much potential there is for overlearning. 

I should really make this an interactive notebook with sliders.
